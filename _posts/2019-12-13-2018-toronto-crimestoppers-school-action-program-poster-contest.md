I entered and was one of the winners of the 2018 Toronto Crimestoppers School Action Program Poster Contest. Posters were showcased at the Toronto Crime Stoppers Dinner honoring Chief Mark Saunders and presented at Toronto [Crimestoppers](https://www.222tips.com/Campaign/Info/0d2dc810-56e4-4045-8930-a99200ff2fe3) School Symposium. The top 3 posters were distributed to schools this year. Here are my poster submissions. Below is the link to others.
