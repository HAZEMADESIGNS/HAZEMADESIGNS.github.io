As Coordinator of Media Team, I was in charge of leading a the team in capturing some of the spirit of the FOY Family during the Muskoka Woods training weekend. This group of centrally staffed Focus on Youth Leaders was assembled to give you the highlights of all Focus on Youth programs, from Scarborough to Etobicoke. They also promote Focus on Youth to future leaders looking for employment and provide the chance to reach out to fellow youth in Toronto neighbourhoods. You'll also find a [CBC news story](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/focus-youth-funding-cut-1.4953243) I had the privilege to take part in linked to if clicked.
